# Blade & Sorcery Items In Shop Injector

Simple application that let's you add items from mods to the shop in Crystal Hunt mode.


## Usage

#### Step by step:
- Run the jar
- Select a tier, that you want your items to be
- Type a price, that you would like your items to be sold for
- Click *Select JSON files with items you want to add to the shop*
- Select one or multiple items. (They are located in your Blade & Sorcery directory in "BladeAndSorcery_Data/StreamingAssets/Mods/${NAME_OF_YOUR_MOD}/Items/...", if you do not see Items directory, create one, it can be empty)
- Click *Run*
- You are good to go!

### Remember to:
#### - always use this app one mod at a time
#### - in case you want to add more items from the mod you previously added items from and you want those *new* items to be the same tier as the already added items, please select all of the items (new and already present). Otherwise old items will be overwritten by new items.

## Why make this?
I searched for a way to easily add items from a mod to the Crystal Hunt (without having to spawn them each time I enter a map), but found none. I created this project, so other people don't have to spend time looking for solution for already solved problem ;)
